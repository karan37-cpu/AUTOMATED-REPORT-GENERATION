## 📌 Project Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to automate the reporting process using Python. The script reads data from an input file (such as a CSV or Excel file), performs basic analysis such as data summaries and statistics, and finally generates a clean, organized PDF report. This project helps eliminate the need for manual report writing and formatting.

The generated reports can include titles, tables, charts, summaries, and other relevant data insights. The project is modular, so the reporting layout can easily be customized based on user requirements. Whether you're handling business reports, academic data, or research analysis, this script saves time and ensures consistency in formatting and structure.
